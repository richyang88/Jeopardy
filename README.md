In this version of Jeopardy, the player must select a row they wish to start at. Becareful though! Once a row has been selected you cannot change your decision and must continue answering all the way through to the right.
The more questions you get right the more points you get. You will be limited to a maximum number of points allowed by your row. Will you choose an easy row or will you choose a harder row? One wrong question and that is the end of the game for you.
